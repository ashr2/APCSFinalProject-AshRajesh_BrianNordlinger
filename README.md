# APCSFinalProject-AshRajesh_BrianNordlinger
This is a project I made in 10th grade with my high-school friend Brian Nordlinger for my AP Computer Science A class, and it was my first Unity project.
Unfortunately, due to a number of factors including:
- I had a poor understanding of Github when I made this project
- I stored the project on a computer that is no longer working and so it's harder to properly document it
- Unity doesn't have a great portable solution to sharing project
- There are gigabytes of non-code assets involved

Due to these factors, I've ended up doing a pretty poor job of storing this project, although at some point when I'm not really busy I'm willing
to try and remake this project using the scripts I do have and assets that I can access and document it more properly here with images and other cool stuff hopefully.

This project isn't anything ground-breaking by any means but it holds a lot of sentimental value to me, and I think it's pretty cool to have been able to make
at least a prototype for a 3d platformer.

If I do end up trying to remake/restore this project I'm also down to add some new features that I didn't have the knowledge to add in 10th grade, but I also kinda
like the "newbie to programming" charm of this, so I feel I might be better off just making a new project that implements cool stuff that I've learnt.
